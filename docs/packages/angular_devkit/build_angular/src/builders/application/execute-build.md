# executeBuild Function Documentation

## Introduction

The `executeBuild` function is part of an Angular building framework. It orchestrates the creation of browser app code bundles, polyfills, global styles, and server app code when necessary. The function is designed to accommodate Internationalization (i18n) options, budgeting, asset management, and licenses extraction. It's structured to support both single-run and watch mode operations and can handle rebuild states for incremental builds.

## Function Documentation

### `executeBuild`

The `executeBuild` function is an asynchronous function that primarily coordinates the build process of an Angular application. Given the build options and the builder context, it handles translations, compiles the code, checks budget constraints, copies assets, extracts licenses, inlines i18n information, calculates file sizes, and logs build information.

**Arguments:**
- `options`: `NormalizedApplicationBuildOptions` - Configurations for various build options like i18n, assets, scripts and styles optimizations.
- `context`: `BuilderContext` - The context of the builder providing access to the workspace, logging, etc.
- `rebuildState?`: `RebuildState` (optional) - An object that contains state information for a rebuild, to enable incremental compilation.

**Logic Flow:**

1. Retrieve browser and server build targets.
2. Load active translations if i18n should be inlined.
3. Setup or reuse bundler contexts for different bundle types:
   - Browser application code
   - Browser polyfills code
   - Global stylesheets
   - Global scripts
   - Server application code (conditionally based on the presence of serverEntryPoint and some options)
4. Execute the bundling process for all contexts.
5. Log any warnings or errors from the bundling process.
6. If there are no errors, perform the following post-bundle operations:
   - Check and log CommonJS module usage.
   - Copy assets to the output directory.
   - Extract and write licenses for third-party packages used.
   - Analyze bundle budgets and log any issues.
   - Calculate the estimated file transfer sizes.
7. If i18n inlining is enabled, perform the inlining.
   Otherwise, execute other post-bundle steps and manage additional assets and output files.
8. Log build statistics including bundle budget information and estimated transfer sizes.
9. Record and log the duration of the build process.
10. If the stats option is enabled, write the metafile containing build statistics.

**Returns:**
- `ExecutionResult` - This object contains the results of the build process, including outputs and assets.

### `printWarningsAndErrorsToConsole` (Utility Function)

A simple utility function to print arrays of warnings and errors to the console using the provided builder context.

**Arguments:**
- `context`: `BuilderContext` - The context for accessing the project's build environment.
- `warnings`: `string[]` - An array of warning messages to log.
- `errors`: `string[]` - An array of error messages to log.

**Flow:**
1. Iterate over the errors array and log each error.
2. Iterate over the warnings array and log each warning.

**Dependencies**

- `@angular-devkit/architect`
- ESBuild associated utilities for application code bundling, polyfill creation, CommonJS checker, and global scripts/styles bundling
- Budget analysis and asset copying utilities
- License extraction and i18n handling

**Installation Instructions:**

To utilize the functionality of the `executeBuild` function and related utilities, you would need to install the Angular development kit and ESBuild, which may require specific setup instructions based on the project's configuration. Typically, these would be set as dependencies in a project's `package.json` file and installed via npm:

```bash
npm install @angular-devkit/architect esbuild
```

Please consult the Angular or ESBuild documentation for detailed installation and setup instructions suited to your project.

**Note:**
The actual installation commands and dependencies may vary depending on the version of the tools and the specific setup of your Angular project.
