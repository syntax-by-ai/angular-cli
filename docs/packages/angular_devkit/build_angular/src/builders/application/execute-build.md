# Angular Devkit Build Angular - Execute Build Function

This documentation explains the `executeBuild` function contained within Angular's Devkit for building Angular applications. The function manages the process of building a browser or server application using various tools and configurations.

## Function Documentation

### `executeBuild`

The `executeBuild` function is responsible for executing the build of an Angular application. It handles compiling the source code, inlining translations, copying assets, checking for CommonJS modules, validating budgets, and providing extensive stats about the build if required.

#### Parameters:
- `options` - (`NormalizedApplicationBuildOptions`) The standardized build options that contain paths, optimization flags, and other necessary configurations.
- `context` - (`BuilderContext`) Provides context such as logging and file access for build operations.
- `rebuildState` - (`RebuildState`) Optional parameter that holds state information for reuse during rebuilds in watch mode.

#### Returns:
- (`Promise<ExecutionResult>`) The function returns a promise that resolves to an `ExecutionResult` containing details of outputs, assets, and any errors that occurred.

#### High-Level Flow:
1. Determine the project's supported browsers and transform them into esbuild targets.
2. If internationalization (i18n) is enabled, load active translations.
3. Create new or reuse existing `BundlerContexts` for the different parts of the application (e.g., application code, stylesheets, scripts).
4. Perform the actual bundling logic by calling `BundlerContext.bundleAll`.
5. Handle logging of messages from the bundling process.
6. If there are any errors, exit early with the results obtained thus far.
7. Execute asset copying and license extraction if enabled.
8. Analyze the bundle for budget violations if budget checks are configured.
9. Calculate estimated file transfer sizes if optimization is enabled.
10. Inline translations if i18n is enabled or execute post-build steps.
11. Log overall build statistics.
12. Record the build time and print it.
13. Generate and save stats file if the stats option is enabled.
14. Return the `ExecutionResult`.

**Additional Function: `printWarningsAndErrorsToConsole`**
- Prints warnings and errors captured during the build process to the console via the provided `BuilderContext`.

### Dependencies
This function relies on a substantial number of internal tools and utilities provided by the Angular Devkit. The list of direct imports includes:

- Architectural objects and helpers such as `BuilderContext`.
- Cache management with `SourceFileCache`.
- Bundle option creators for browser and server contexts.
- Budget stats generation.
- CommonJS checkers, global script/style bundling options, and license extractors.
- Utilities for copying assets, determining supported browsers/node versions, logging build stats, and transforming browsers into targets.
- Bundling-related objects and results such as `BuildOutputFileType` and `BundlerContext`.
- Post-bundle execution steps.
- i18n inlining functions and translation loaders.

To make use of this function in the applications, ensure all parent packages and dependencies are correctly installed via the Angular package manager, using `npm` or `yarn`.
