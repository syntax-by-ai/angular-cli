# Angular ESBuild ExecuteBuild Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the `executeBuild` function within the Angular ESBuild package. The `executeBuild` function is responsible for orchestrating the build process of Angular applications using ESBuild. The build process involves several steps including but not limited to translating inline i18n, bundling application code, global styles, and global scripts, extracting licenses, and copying assets.

## Function Documentation

### executeBuild

The `executeBuild` function takes three parameters:

- `options` of type `NormalizedApplicationBuildOptions` which includes all the necessary options to configure the build process.
- `context` of type `BuilderContext` which provides the build context that contains various utilities for logging and interacting with the build process.
- `rebuildState` which is an optional parameter of type `RebuildState` that captures the state for watch mode rebuilds.

A high-level flow of the `executeBuild` function is as follows:

1. Initialize the start time for performance measurements.
2. Determine the set of supported browsers and transform them into ESBuild targets.
3. Load active translations if inlining i18n is required.
4. Create or reuse bundler contexts for bundling application code, polyfills, global scripts, and styles.
5. Perform the actual bundling process using ESBuild through the `BundlerContext.bundleAll` method.
6. Log any messages resulting from the bundling process.
7. Handle the execution of the build process, including checks for CommonJS modules if necessary.
8. Copy specified assets to the output directory.
9. Extract and write licenses for packages used if configured to do so.
10. Analyze built files against budget constraints if defined, and log any budget-related issues.
11. Calculate estimated transfer sizes for minified scripts and styles if optimization is enabled.
12. Inline i18n translations or execute post-bundle steps depending on the i18n configurations.
13. Log the final build statistics including budget failures, transfer sizes, and build time.
14. If the `stats` option is enabled, generate a build statistics metafile.
15. Return an instance of `ExecutionResult`, containing information about the executed build.

### printWarningsAndErrorsToConsole

A utility function that takes a BuilderContext, a list of warning messages, and a list of error messages as parameters. It iterates through the errors and warnings and logs them using the context's logger, marking them appropriately as errors or warnings in the console.

## Dependencies

This module relies on several Angular ESBuild tools and utilities. Since it's part of an Angular package, the actual installation and handling of these dependencies are managed by the Angular CLI and its build system. Users integrating this code into their projects will not typically interact with these dependencies directly.

However, for an independent setup or for contribution purposes, the following tools are employed and their corresponding packages would be required:

- `@angular-devkit/architect`
- ESBuild and related ESBuild Angular plugins
- Other Angular utility modules for tasks like bundle calculation, asset copying, and i18n handling
