# Angular Application Build Preload Hints

This documentation provides an overview and detailed information regarding the recent changes made to the Angular application build process. These changes specifically address the behavior of preload hints in the generated build artifacts.

## Function/Class Documentation:

### describeBuilder()

This function is used to set up test cases for the Angular build application behavior. There are two primary test cases:

1. `should add preload hints for transitive global style imports`:
   - The test writes a global style file `src/styles.css` that imports fonts from Google's font API.
   - The `build` target is then configured to include the `src/styles.css` file.
   - It executes the build process once and expects the build to succeed.
   - The resulting `index.html` file in the `dist/browser` directory is checked to contain a `preload` link for the imported fonts.

    Flow:
    ```
    Write global styles file (src/styles.css) with font import
    Configure build target to include styles file
    Execute build
    └─ Expect success
          └─ Check index.html to contain preload link for fonts
    ```

2. `should not add preload hints for ssr files`:
   - This test modifies the `src/tsconfig.app.json` to include server-side script references.
   - It writes a simple `src/server.ts` script simulating server-side logic.
   - The `build` target is configured for server-side rendering (SSR) by referencing `src/main.server.ts`.
   - The build is executed and expected to succeed without including `modulepreload` hints in the `index.html`.

    Flow:
    ```
    Modify tsconfig.app.json to include server-side scripts
    Write server script (src/server.ts)
    Configure build target for SSR with main.server.ts reference
    Execute build
    └─ Expect success without modulepreload hints in index.html
    ```

## Dependencies

The tests in the provided code rely on a testing harness and the Angular build infrastructure, which includes, but may not be limited to, the following:

- Angular build tools and framework
- Jasmine test framework for the `expect` assertions

For setting up these dependencies, please ensure you are within an Angular project and have the necessary development packages installed:

```bash
npm install @angular/cli jasmine-core --save-dev
```

The exact installation commands depend on the specific versions and configuration of your Angular project.
